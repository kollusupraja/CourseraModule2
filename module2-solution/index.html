      <p1>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. 
        It is used to structure content on the web, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. 
        HTML is the backbone of every website and is used to create the structure and layout of a webpage. 
        With HTML, web developers can create content that can be viewed by anyone with an internet connection, on any device.</p1>
      <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. 
        CSS allows developers to style and format web pages, including fonts, colors, layouts, and backgrounds. With CSS, developers can create visually appealing and responsive websites that look great on any device. 
        CSS separates the presentation of a webpage from its content, allowing for easier maintenance and customization.</p>
      <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive and dynamic websites.
        It is used to add functionality to web pages, such as animations, form validation, and dynamic content. JavaScript is executed in the browser, making it a client-side scripting language. 
        With JavaScript, developers can create powerful web applications that can run seamlessly in the browser, without the need for server-side processing. JavaScript is widely used in web development and is considered a fundamental skill for web developers.</p>
